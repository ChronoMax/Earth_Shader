# Earth_Shader
This project contains an earth that is created with the shaders/shader graph in Unity.

For the best experience download from the release tab of this project. If you want to fork or clone the repository feel free to do so!
I made this using an online tutorial explaining shaders/shader graphs in Unity. Everything more than the tutorial in this project is made by me.
